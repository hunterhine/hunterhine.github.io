        <p>Since the 2021 Fall semester began, reports of larceny theft at University of Maryland have risen to more
            closely resemble pre-pandemic trends, according to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.umpd.umd.edu/">
                University of Maryland Police
                Department's</a> crime reporting. </p>

        <p>However, reported crime statistics don't always accurately portray the full extent of crime, according to two
            University of Maryland criminology professors. </p>

        <p>The UMPD currently submits its crime data to the FBI through the Uniform Crime Report Summary Reporting
            System, or SRS, said UMPD spokesperson Sgt. Rosanne Hoaas. </p>
        <p>The SRS tracks eight types of crime called index crimes, according to University of Maryland Criminology and
            Criminal Justice Research Professor <a target="_blank"
                href="https://ccjs.umd.edu/facultyprofile/lynch/james">James Lynch.</a> Lynch previously served as
            director of the Bureau of
            Justice Statistics.</p>
        <p>However, this year, the UMPD received its certification for the National Incident-Based Reporting System, or
            NIBRS, Hoaas said. NIBRS is a newer data system that collects more detail for each reported crime, and
            unlike the SRS, it can classify a single incident with several separate offensenses, according to the FBI
            website.</p>

        <p>The UMPD is currently transitioning from the SRS to NIBRS, Hoaas said.</p>



        <p>“Once we are fully ready to go we will make some form of public announcements or community notes because it's
            going to change the way that the recording looks,” Hoaas said.</p>
        <p>The effects of the pandemic on crime and crime reporting are visible in the UMPD UCR’s statistics, Hoaas
            said.</p>
        <p>
            In any given year, larceny theft is the most commonly reported crime at University of Maryland. In April of
            2020, larceny theft reporting dropped to just 2 reports, compared to 17 reports in April 2019, according to
            the UMPD UCR. The drop is mostly attributable to the pandemic because there wasn’t a full campus, Hoaas
            said. University of Maryland transitioned to online school in April 2020 because of COVID-19.
        </p>
        <p>In 2019, University of Maryland’s theft reports totaled at 243, according to the UCR. In 2020 they totalled
            152, and in 2021 the total was 147. That’s a nearly 40% drop in larceny reports between 2019 and 2021. By
            September 2021, when students began returning to in person classes, reports of larceny increased.

        <p>But, there is a difference between how much crime truly occurs, and how much is reported to police, Lynch
            said. </p>
        <p>The 2020 BJS National Crime Victimization Survey, or NCVS, found that only about 40% of violent
            victimizations and only about 33% of property victimizations were reported to police, according to
            the BJS.</p>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://ccjs.umd.edu/facultyprofile/midgette/greg">Greg Midgette,</a> an assistant
            professor in the University of Maryland’s Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice said that since the
            crime victimization survey is anonymous, it's expected that victims’ reporting bias is mitigated, giving a
            better look into true crime levels. </p>
        <p>Many factors influence whether someone will report a crime, including the stigma of being a victim of certain
            crimes and whether or not a victim finds law enforcement trustworthy or reliable, Midgette said. It also
            depends on individual characteristics, such as age, socio-economic status, and whether or not the victim has
            a relationship with the perpetrator, Midgette said.</p>
        <p>Midgette said that policing a university comes with unique factors that might affect crime reporting.
            Students and faculty at University of Maryland come from all over and bring different perspectives on crime
            and police, so their inclination to report a crime might vary greatly based on their past experience and
            beliefs, Midgette said.</p>
        <p>
            “The police data is not going to be really good for minor assaults, for rapes, sexual assaults, typically,
            because citizens don't report them for a lot of complicated reasons,” Lynch said.

        <p>Lynch said he believes university police at large might face pressure to downplay crime. </p>
        <p>“Some universities will get pressure. That doesn't mean they'll give into the pressure. They'll get pressure
            to downplay crime because it's bad for business,” Lynch said.</p>
        <p> Lynch did not reference the UMPD specifically, nor did he suggest the university’s police doctor their
            statistics. Lynch praised the transparency of the UMPD.</p>

        <p>“For us, if anything, we write more reports than you would find in a traditional Police Department, period.
            We
            are documenting things. You know, if you ask another police department, they would say no, we don't write
            reports for that, but we do,” Hoaas said.</p>
